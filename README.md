# ensemble-feature-selection-benchmark
Feature selection methods, aggregation methods, time and energy consumption benchmarking tool.

Feature selection methods are used to reduce the number of features by selecting the most important and removing 
irrelevant ones. This is done to reduce the curse of dimensionality, increase the performance of a machine learning model 
and to build simpler and faster models. There is also the possibility of ensemble feature selection by aggregating the 
results of the feature selection methods to achieve even better results and improve the robustness of the feature 
selection. The main disadvantage of using ensemble feature selection are the computational costs.
